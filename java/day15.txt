classes have getter,setter,to string,hashcode,equals-->called pojo
equals method check the equlity
hash code..>if 2 are equal then check hash code is also equal

set..>have no order but always unique

Hashset is unique and doesn't follow any order.
In treeset all the elements will be sorted
LinkedHashSet follows the order of insertion 


Set<Integer>nums=new TreeSet<>();-->sorted way
Set<Integer>nums=new HashSet<>();--->based on hash code ,we can't predict the order
Set<Integer>nums=new LinkedHashSet<>();-->no duplicate,printed the element in the order which we are enterd



How to sort a collection.
................
Collection.sort(List)



Layerd Architecture
............
we divided different classes an interface as per their purpose.
-ui layer
-business layer/service layer
-repository layer/DAO layer/persistance layer
-model/entity layer
