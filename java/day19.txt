lambda expression:implementaion of functional interface
functional interface:interface with single abstract methos
streamapi:filter:filter data based on condition
map:changes the value
reduce:reduce the entire stream in to single value
stream:squence of data


filter and map called intermediate method--will return another stream
reduce called termination method--will return an integer value.we can't do map or filter after this

compare problem is solved by compartor
in any stream we can use soretd inside comprator 
Comparator<Employee> compareByName=(emp1,emp2)->emp1.getEmployeeName().compareTo(emp2.getEmployeeName());
