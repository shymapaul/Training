enum
......
it's special class-group of constant

eg:enum Days
{
SUNDAY;
MONDAY,...
FRIDAY
}
day=DAY.SUNDAY--->CORRECT
day=DAY.FUNDAY---->NOT WORK
comstant must be in uppercase



wrapper class
.....
Integer.parseInt("15");
then it return 15
parseInt is a static method we don't need to create any object.


Inheritance
......
inheritance the properties of one class to another class. we can not inherit private.
Parent class called -super class
child class-subclass-derived calss
extends-extends the properties and methods of that class to this class
something is protect-child class can access.
when inside the same  package all class can access.
when outside the package only child class can access


fuelengine mycar=(fuelengine) new car;--->only valid if use child class to create object.(type casting)
we can accees the properities which are declared as default,public,protect(inside same package)
............................................
car mycar=new ev();
we can't call methods only in ev not in car .
but ev mycar=new ev(); ...now it's working.


static ploymorphism
.............
overloading:both methods are inside the same class and same method name and different parameter
runtime polymorphism
.......
method overriding
...............
subclass method override the super class called overriding.
same method name,same parameter,same data type
one class should be  in the parent class and one in the base class
super()
...........
super refers to object of parent class
super and this keyword do not write inside static method.





super class constructor always created
super can be method or object of parent class. super()--->it is a method,super-->object and it should be first line of the method.
